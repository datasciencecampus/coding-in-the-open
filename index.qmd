title: "Coding in the Open"
subtitle: "Guidance for open sourcing at ONS Data Science Campus"
---

The following pages provide guidance on 'coding in the open' - developing open-source codebases or transitioning codebases from private to public domains. 

The term open-source captures work that is made freely available for others to use and modify @OpenSourceInitiative.

The benefits to open-source codebases are greater accountability, collaboration, and trust.

This guide does not replace any of the guidance in the UK Government's Aqua Book @AquaBook, but instead supplements with considerations related specifically to publishing analytical code on GitHub. 

This guide supports, not replaces, the need for good project governance.

# How to use this guide
