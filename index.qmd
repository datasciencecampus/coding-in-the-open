subtitle: "Guidance for open sourcing at ONS Data Science Campus."

The following pages provide guidance on 'coding in the open' - developing open-source codebases or transitioning codebases from private to public domains. This guidance is based upon
**NHS Digital guidance** @NHSdigital. [Click here to download NHS Digital's fit for publishing checklist](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/images/Fit_for_publishing_checklist.docx).

The term open-source captures work that is made freely available for others to use and modify @OpenSourceInitiative.

The benefits to open-source codebases are greater accountability, collaboration, and trust.

This guide does not replace any of the guidance in the UK Government's Aqua Book @AquaBook, but instead supplements with considerations related specifically to publishing analytical code on GitHub. 

This guide supports, not replaces, the need for good project governance.
