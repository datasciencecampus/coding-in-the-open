Points to consider (not necessarily in this order):

- Publishing with/without History
- Repository tagging/labelling
- Key and Credential Management
- Publishing with intention for further development and/or on-going maintenance:
    - contribution guidance (issues/PR templates)
    - semantic versioning
    - change log
- Following coding good practices:
    - recommend ONS code quality assurance as it will cover styles, functional code, unit testing, version control, minimising disclosure risks: repo structure (but still point to our own), pre-commit, gitignore,
- Documentation (readmes, and more?)
- Licenses
- Use open source tools/software/data
- Dummy data
- Notebooks or not to notebooks... (what about gists? maybe part of documentation)
- Skill-sets/training
