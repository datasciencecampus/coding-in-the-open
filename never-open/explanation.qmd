## Context: An increasing reliance on closed-source

Since it inception, the Data Science Campus has been committed to supporting
the open-source community and has published code, tools and websites through
GitHub in the pursuit of its mission statement.

### Data Science Campus Mission Statement
Data Science for the Public Good.
:::

In late 2021, the attention of analysts across the UK public sector had
been drawn to various GitHub repositories that were being used to maintain a
record of all open source development in the public sector, such as the
[Unofficial UK Government Mirror](https://github.com/uk-gov-mirror). The net
result of such activity has affected the public-sector attitude towards
open-source by default.

As of the time of writing (7th September 2023), just 103 of 596 (17.2%)
repositories belonging to the Data Science Campus are public. Over 4/5ths of
the Campus' repositories today are private. Are we serving the public good if
we don't share the nuts and bolts of what we do?

Browsing these private repositories, I would admit to not having enough
context to make decisions about their visibility, but at a quick glance I
suggest the majority of these repositories sound benign and could be opened at
very little cost to the taxpayer.

In order to assess whether our code should be published or not, it is important
to assert the types of reasons that qualify a project for closed-source
development and what potential drivers are inappropriate. 

## Closed source: Why is it an option?


## Poor reasons for private repos

* **Potential Driver**: 'What good would releasing the work do? Much of it is
of little relevance to others or are failed experiments.'
**Response**: A valid point is made as not everything we initiate will be
carried forward into production. But why keep experiments secret? Are we
insecure in sharing failed experiments? Would it be a bad thing for others to
succeed based off a failed experiment of ours? Wouldn't such a hypothetical
situation would present a valuable learning opportunity to the public sector
and open source community. Making a public archive of such a repository would
be a better scenario, clearly demarking to any potential users that the code is
not maintained.

* **Potential Driver**: 'I'm worried about exposing my work, it may not be
polished code and I'm not certain that I've done everything right'.
**Response**: This type of statement hints at a broader sensitivity to open
development, which could be partially influenced by an organisational culture
of publication after development. Generally the project lead should revisit
the GitHub training@DSCGitHubTraining and advice in this site with their team
and prepare to publish their work.
We aim to publish code that works, is secure and is maintainable. It may not
always be consistent, efficient or clever. Some polishing of code should happen
at the peer review stage and ensuring that merging to the main branch is
mediated by peer review helps to mitigate risk of degrading code standards. It
is important to state that not all projects have been able to resource regular
and timely code review. This is a risk that should be clearly stated in the
project governance and escalated through the project lead.
Work in progress within feature branches is typically treated with a different
standard until it has been prepared for a Pull Request. Mitigating risk of
dangerous activity within any branch is largely achieved through our corporate
adoption of pre-commit. Please consult the
[Data Science Campus GitHub Training](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/DSCA_GitHub_Training/blob/main/course/2_security_and_tools.md#git-hooks) for more details on how to use pre-commit.
Work in progress can be clearly communicated within the readme by a
statement and / or a repository shield. [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) is a
service that can be used to generate links to customisable badges for use
within sites.
Lastly, open sourcing your code helps improve its quality. Bringing the work
under the scrutiny of the open source community helps to increase the
transparency in all that we do as a government department and builds trust with
the public. A general unease with releasing code potentially introduces risk,
