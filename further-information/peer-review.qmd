This page sets out general guidance for standards of review. It intends to help
raise awareness in issues that could be encountered while preparing to release
code. 

When reviewing code, it is recommended that you consult pre-existing sources of
peer review guidance. The ONS duck book provides low, moderate and high quality
peer review checklists @DuckBookChecklists. The NHS fit for publishing
checklist @NHSFit4Publishing is also a useful tool for peer review.

At the time of writing, the following sources were compared with review
considerations collated from Campus colleagues. The following checks were not
explicitly covered in the Duckbook or NHS checklists and are presented
here for completeness.

#### Complementary checks

**Warning**: Not a complete checklist. Please consult the sources above to
ensure code is of an appropriate quality prior to publication.

- [ ] Check for broken links in the documentation.
- [ ] Actively try to break the code by considering edge cases. Are the
important exceptions raised correctly?
- [ ] Is the API intuitive and consistent? Do modules follow the same naming
conventions etc?
- [ ] Create a new environment and rebuild the package. A useful way to
detect breaking changes in dependencies.
- [ ] On pull request, note any merge conflicts between the feature and target
branch.
