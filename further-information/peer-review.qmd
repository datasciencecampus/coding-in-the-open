This page sets out general guidance for standards of review. It intends to help
raise awareness in issues that could be encountered while preparing to release
code. Remember to refer to NHS Digital's guidance @NHSdigital.

Let's help each other to avoid common problems prior to publishing:

## Documentation

Have you:  

- [ ] checked that all the links work in your README?  
- [ ] included some helpful code status description, ie maintained, ad hoc analysis etc?  
- [ ] fully attributed the work of others? Including a [LICENSE.note](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/accessrmd/blob/main/LICENSE.note) file where appropriate?  
- [ ] specified which operating system the code is compatible with?  

## Source Code

Reviewing code for release is a bit like the review of a Pull Request. 

Have you:  

- [ ] read through the code?
- [ ] ran the code line by line?
- [ ] checked that the code runs in a fresh clone of the repo and in a new environment?  
- [ ] been able to `pip install -r requirements.txt` without any trouble?  

## Notebooks

Have you:

- [ ] checked that notebooks are wiped by `nbstripout` pre-commit hook?
- [ ] inspected notebook outputs HTML for secret credentials if `nbstripout` is
not being used?

## Tests

Have you: 

- [ ] checked that pytest passes?
- [ ] checked `precommit run â€”all-files` indicates developers have consistent pre-commit setup?
- [ ] checked the coverage report for missed behaviours?
