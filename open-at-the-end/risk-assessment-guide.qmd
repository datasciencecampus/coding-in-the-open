Important things to consider in your risk assessment - follow the reference link to a helpful NHS checklist template @NHSFit4Publishing: 

- How will you ensure no passwords, data or other sensitive information is shared by making your repo public?
- How will you safeguard against people accidentally pushing this information in the future after the repo is made public? 
- How will you manage users expectations of quality and on-going maintenance?
- How will you use licencing to protect any proprietary rights and set limitations on liability from others using your code?
